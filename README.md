# DepthSense AI: Transforming Images into 3D Realities

DepthSense AI is a project that aims to transform 2D images into immersive 3D visualizations using artificial intelligence techniques. The project consists of several services, each focusing on a specific aspect of the transformation pipeline.

## Services

1. **DepthNet AI: Mapping Dimensions from Images**
   - Description: DepthNet AI is a service that estimates depth information from 2D images, generating depth maps that represent the distance of objects from the camera for each pixel.
   - Repository: [Link to DepthNet AI repository]
   - Usage: [Instructions on how to use DepthNet AI service]

2. **SurfaceCraft AI: Sculpting Realities from Depths**
   - Description: SurfaceCraft AI is a service that reconstructs the 3D geometry of a scene's surface from depth maps generated by DepthNet AI. It uses surface reconstruction algorithms to create 3D representations of the scene.
   - Repository: [Link to SurfaceCraft AI repository]
   - Usage: [Instructions on how to use SurfaceCraft AI service]

3. **TextureForge AI: Painting Realism onto 3D Worlds**
   - Description: TextureForge AI is a service that applies texture mapping to the 3D representations generated by SurfaceCraft AI. It maps the original 2D images onto the 3D geometry to create realistic textured models.
   - Repository: [Link to TextureForge AI repository]
   - Usage: [Instructions on how to use TextureForge AI service]
